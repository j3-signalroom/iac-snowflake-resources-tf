# IaC Snowflake Resources Terraform Configuration
[Terraform](https://terraform.io) is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.  It functions as a declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, meaning instead of providing step-by-step imperative instructions like with SQL, JavaScript, or Python, you can specify what you want using a YAML-like syntax.  Terraform maintains a record of your current state and compares it with your desired state.  It then generates a reconciliation plan between the two states, which Terraform can execute to create new resources or update/delete existing ones.  This plan is represented as an acyclic graph and enables Terraform to comprehend and manage dependencies between resources.  Terraform is an effective tool for managing various [Snowflake resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest) at the account level, including Warehouses, Databases, Schemas, Tables, Roles/Grants, etc.
